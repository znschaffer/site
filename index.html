<ul>
<li><p>I am a twenty-seven year old computer science student at <a href="https://northseattle.edu">North Seattle College</a></p></li>
<li><p>I was born in Seattle, grew up in Bellevue, and have <a href="./travels">lived in many places</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>I have been writing and producing music for most of my adult life. You can learn more about my musical endeavours <a href="./music">here</a>.</p></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="whats-going-on-now">Whats Going On Now?</h2>
<p>Currently, I live on Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington with Xinrui and our cat Cleo. I spend a lot of time learning about programming language design, studying higher level math and calculus, researching self-hosted projects, and making noises on my synths.</p>
<p>I’m building a real-time chat and drawing app with Xinrui to advance my knowledge of web sockets and different networking protocols. It’s going great!</p>
<p>A lot of my current time is taken up by the <em>pursuit of education</em> I am subjecting myself to. I’ve gone self-taught for most everything in computer science but enough is enough! Through this process, I have discovered an odd, but intriguing appreciation for mathematics I did not possess before. Luckily, audio programming and it’s related domains expect you to be fascinated with mathematics.</p>
