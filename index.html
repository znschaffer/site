    <h2>Life Facts!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>I have been writing, and sporadically living off of my music, for
          most of my adult life. You can learn more about my sonic endeavours <a href="./music">here</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I was born in Seattle, grew up in Bellevue, and have <a href="./travels">lived in many places</a>!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I am currently a computer science student at <a href="https://northseattle.edu">North Seattle College</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I am exploring the realm of <a href="https://img.znschaffer.com">photography</a>
          with a camera from 2006</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>My partner, <a href="https://xinrui.work">Xinrui</a>, a fellow
          creative turned tech-worker, shares a small, but cozy, space with me and
          our cat Cleo in Capitol Hill</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="whats-going-on-now">What’s Going On Now?</h2>

    <p>Currently, I live on Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
      with Xinrui and our cat Cleo. I spend a lot of time learning about
      programming language design, studying higher level math and calculus,
      researching self-hosted projects, and making noises on my synths.</p>
    <p>A lot of my current time is taken up by the <em>pursuit of
        education</em> I am subjecting myself to. I have been <em>self-taught</em> for most
      everything in computer science but enough is enough! Through this
      process, I have discovered an odd, but intriguing appreciation for
      mathematics I did not possess before. Luckily, audio programming, and
      it’s related domains expect you to be fascinated with mathematics!</p>

        <p>There seems to be a split between those who consider it
          to be living ‘on’ or ‘in’ Capitol Hill. I prefer on, as to acknowledge
          the greater calf strength I now possess.
