<h2 id="life-facts">Life Facts!</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I am a twenty-seven year old computer science student at <a
href="https://northseattle.edu">North Seattle College</a></p></li>
<li><p>I was born in Seattle, grew up in Bellevue, and have <a
href="./travels">lived in many places</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>I have been writing and producing music for most of my adult
life. You can learn more about my musical endeavours <a
href="./music">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I enjoy working on <a href="./projects">projects</a> and learning
new skills.</p></li>
<li><p>My partner, <a href="https://xinrui.work">Xinrui</a>, is an
extremely talented and lovely individual</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-going-on-now">Whats Going On Now?</h2>
<p>Currently, I live on Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington with Xinrui
and our cat Cleo. I spend a lot of time learning about programming
language design, studying higher level math and calculus, researching
self-hosted projects, and making noises on my synths.</p>
<p>I’m building a real-time chat and drawing app with Xinrui to advance
my knowledge of web sockets and different networking protocols. It’s
going great!</p>
<p>A lot of my current time is taken up by the <em>pursuit of
education</em> I am subjecting myself to. I’ve gone self-taught for most
everything in computer science but enough is enough! Through this
process, I have discovered an odd, but intriguing appreciation for
mathematics I did not possess before. Luckily, audio programming and
it’s related domains expect you to be fascinated with mathematics.</p>
