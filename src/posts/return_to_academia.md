At age 27, I have successfully rekindled my interest in learning, if such a
thing ever honestly existed. 

# History

As I’ve traversed through my life, empowered by my own philosophy of
*self-taught or bust*, I have encountered roadblocks of different magnitudes.

Certain things are hard for me. Writing eloquently, as I am attentively
attempting to do currently, was forever placed into the “not gonna learn that”
bucket. School subjects that included few large projects with rigid due dates
where the classroom must bring their projects in for peer-review.
