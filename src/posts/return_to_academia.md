At age 27, I have successfully rekindled my interest in learning, if such a
thing ever honestly existed. 


# Some Background

I never really liked school - my difficulties with finishing assignments on
time, a cluttered book-bag, the continued confusion of my parents and the
faculty. Graduating with a meager 2.1 GPA felt like a final release from that
burden. A new change to do something with my life that didn't feel so *confusing*.
