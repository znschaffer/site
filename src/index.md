## Life Facts!

- I have been writing and producing and living off of my music for most of my adult life. You can learn more about my musical endeavours [here](./music).

- I was born in Seattle, grew up in Bellevue, and have [lived in many places](./travels)!

- I am currently a computer science student at [North Seattle College](https://northseattle.edu)

- I enjoy working on [projects](./projects) and learning new skills.

- My partner, [Xinrui](https://xinrui.work), a fellow creative turned tech-worker, shares a small, but cozy, space with me and our cat Cleo in Capitol Hill

## Whats Going On Now?

Currently, I live on Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington[^in-on-debate] with Xinrui and our cat
Cleo. I spend a lot of time learning about programming language design, studying
higher level math and calculus, researching self-hosted projects, and making noises
on my synths.

I'm building a real-time chat and drawing app with Xinrui to advance my knowledge
of web sockets and different networking protocols. It's going great!

A lot of my current time is taken up by the _pursuit of education_ I am subjecting myself to.
I've gone self-taught for most everything in computer science but enough is enough! Through this
process, I have discovered an odd, but intriguing appreciation for mathematics I did not possess before.
Luckily, audio programming and it's related domains expect you to be fascinated with mathematics.

[^in-on-debate]: There seems to be a split between those who consider it to be
    living 'on' or 'in' Capitol Hill. I prefer on, as to acknowledge the greater
    calf strength I now possess.
