### Preface
I'm not as active in making and releasing music these days. You'll
find most of my music released on the platforms listed below. 


# Platforms

Most of my music is accessible (begrudgingly) via
[*Spotify*](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2stp6XCHbjsyVmOYGyYBuz?si=i3yoQQjXTY-YWtr2vZ96Aw)

You can also find me on Apple Music, Tidal, and other major streaming platforms.

A small body of my work is available on [Bandcamp](https://zaneschaffer.bandcamp.com)
