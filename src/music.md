![Me playing the trombone](img/trombone.webp)
I grew up playing *jazz trombone* throughout middle and high school, eventually
catching the electronic music bug and finding myself working in FL Studio. After
realizing what a mistake of software that is, I moved myself over to Ableton. I
would describe my musical influences as jazzy, noisy, bleepy, and bloopy. I've made
things ranging from soft soothing _lo-fi hip-hop_ to repugnant noisey wall-of-sound.

-------

Currently, I'm fond of odd analog sound machines - instrument creators currently inspiring
me include: *Lorre Mill*, *Ciat Lonbarde*, and the general *4U Modular* scene.
