<p>~My Things and Where They Come From.~</p>
<p><img src="src/img/trombone.webp" alt="Me playing the trombone" /> I grew up playing <em>jazz trombone</em> throughout middle and high school, eventually catching the electronic music bug and finding myself working in FL Studio. After realizing what a mistake of software that is, I moved myself over to Ableton. I would describe my musical influences as jazzy, noisy, bleepy, and bloopy. I’ve made things ranging from soft soothing <em>lo-fi hip-hop</em> to repugnant noisey wall-of-sound.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m fond of odd analog sound machines - instrument creators currently inspiring me include: Lorre Mill, Ciat Lonbarde, 4U Modular.</p>
