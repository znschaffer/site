    <h1>Music and Sound</h1>
    <p>I grew up playing <strong>jazz trombone</strong> throughout middle and high
      school, eventually catching the electronic music bug and finding myself
      working in FL Studio. After realizing what a mistake of software that
      is, I moved myself over to Ableton. I would describe my musical
      influences as jazzy, noisy, bleepy, and bloopy. I’ve made things ranging
      from soft soothing <em>lo-fi hip-hop</em> to repugnant noisey
      wall-of-sound.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Currently, I’m fond of odd analog sound machines - instrument
      creators currently inspiring me include: <em>Lorre Mill</em>, <em>Ciat
        Lonbarde</em>, and the general <em>4U Modular</em> scene.</p>

      <p>I’m not as active in making and releasing music these days. You’ll
        find most of my music released on the platforms listed below.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There’s an interactive explorer of audio experiments <a href="https://sounds.znschaffer.com">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Most of my music is accessible (begrudgingly) via <a
        href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1stp6XCHbjsyVmOYGyYBuz?si=36VIXAnjTwa4rz_CJov7_Q">Spotify</a>.</p>
    <p>You can also find me on Apple Music, Tidal, and other major streaming
      platforms.</p>
    <p>A small body of my work is available on <a href="https://zaneschaffer.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a></p>
